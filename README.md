# Pumsy Bank

> A point/bank system for teachers to use with their students. Teachers can give or take points(unopinionated currency) for various reasons to bee redeemed by students for rewards or prizes.

> Built using a Node server with `graphql-yoga` framework, `postgres` database, and `prisma` as an ORM.

## Install

Install packages:  

> ```yarn``` or ```npm install```

Create/run docker:  

> ```docker-compose up -d```

Deploy Prisma:  

> ```prisma deploy```

## Run

Run start script:  

> ```yarn start``` or ```npm run start```

**This will run the server and database. You will need to run the client(parent or teacher) as well.*
